Notes on Implementing Indenting of the Current Line in Janet Code

Things to Keep in Mind

* For the most basic kind of indentation, only the current line is
  affected, no line above or below is affected.  Other kinds of
  indentation may be built based on the basic form.

* There is at least one case where a line should not be indented.
  When the start of the current line is within a multi-line string
  that started on some previous line, no indentation should occur.
  (Not sure if there are other cases.)  If additional cases are found,
  it might be possible to fit them into the scheme described below.

* When a line should be indented, the content of the current line does
  not affect what the indentation should be.  The indentation is
  completely determined by content on some or all of the previous
  lines.

Steps

* If the current line starts off already within a string (though does
  not start with string / long string delimiters), it does not get
  indented.  This is the case of a multi-line string where the start
  of the string is on some previous line.  As a concrete example,
  imagine a long string in Janet that started on line 10 and the
  current line number is 11.

  10: ``hello
  11: world``

  If the following all hold, do not indent the current line:

  * The character starting at column zero of the current line is
    part of a string.

  * The current line's line number is different from the line number
    of the start of the string.

* Otherwise, the line could have some indentation.  First, find the
  left-most non-whitespace character for the current line.  This is
  referred to by some as the "indentation point" of a line.

* Determine the "context" of the current line's left-most
  non-whitespace character (indentation point), as determined in the
  previous step.  The "context" corresponds to the smallest "container"
  form "surrounding" the indentation point.

  For example, suppose there are the following lines:

    (defn a
      []
      (+ 1 1)) # current line

  The indentation point for the current line is "(".
  The context form corresponds to "(defn a\n  []\n  (+ 1 1))".

  Here's another example.  Suppose there are the following lines:

    (print "hello"
      ) # current line

  The indentation point for the current line is ")".
  The context form corresponds to "(print \"hello\"\n  )".

  Note that for (, the context form is the parent, but for ),
  the context form is the one that ) is part of.

  XXX: The above should be checked.

* Determine the desired indentation for the current line.  That is,
  calculate which column the current line's left-most non-whitespace
  character should be located at.

  There appear to be four cases.

  The current line's left-most non-whitespace character's context is:

  1. A non-paren-tuple container (e.g. bracket tuple, array, struct,
     table)

     [:a
      :b  # current line
      :c]

     @["1"
       "2"
       "3"] # current line

     {:a 1
      :b 2} # current line

     @{:x 9
       :y 0} # current line

     => indent by 1 relative to the last character of the opening
        delimiter of the context form (e.g. `[`, or `{`).

  2. An empty paren-tuple

     (
      ) # current line

     => indent by 1 relative to the opening delimiter

  3. A paren-tuple "special" form case (e.g. def, when, let, etc.)

     (def a 1)

     (defn my-fn
       []
       (+ 8 1))

     (let [x 1]
       (+ x 1))

     Count the number of child expressions for the context form that
     exist before the current line.

     a. No such child forms exist
   
        => indent by 1 relative to open paren (which is on some
           previous line)

        (
         def a 1) # current line

     b. Exactly one child form exists
   
        => indent by 2 relative to open paren

        (def
          a 1) # current line

     c. Two or more child forms exist

        => indent by 2 relative to open paren

                                -OR-
   
        => indent to match the left-most character of first child form
           on closest previous line (except if prev line has first
           child form?)

        (def
          a
          1) # current line

        (let [x 1]
          (set y 2)
          # a comment
          (+ x y)) # current line

  4. A paren-tuple vanilla function (or macro) call

     (+ 1 0)

     (-> numbers
         (map inc)
         (apply max))

     Count the number of child forms for the context form that
     exist before the current line.

     a. No such child form exists
   
        => indent by 1 relative to open paren (which is on some
           previous line)

        (
         print "hello") # current line

     b. Exactly one child form exists
   
        => indent by 2 relative to open paren

        (print
          "hello") # current line

     c. Two or more child forms exist
   
        => indent to match left-most character of second child form

                                -OR-

        => indent to match left-most character of first child form on
           closest previous line

                                -OR-

        => indent to match where the second child form would have started
           if it had been on the same line as the first child form

        (print "alpha"
               "beta") # current line

        (put @{:a 1}
             :b 2
             # fun comment
             :c 3) # current line

  Assuming the simplest idea is chosen for each case, in all cases except
  for 4.c., the desired indentation is:

    column position of last character of opening delimiter of context form +
    some number (usually 1 or 2)

  For case 4.c., the desired indentation is:

    column position of left-most character (i.e. start) of second child form

* If necessary, adjust the amount of leading whitespace on the current line
  using the desired indentation determined in the previous step.

  * If the leading whitespace is already the right amount, don't
    change anything.
    
  * If there is too much leading whitespace, delete an appropriate amount.

  * If there is not enough leading whitespace, add an appropriate amount.

  Note that in the last case, this may lead to there being more
  characters on the line than one might want (e.g. > 80 columns for
  some people).  For the moment, don't try to do anything about this.

Notes

1) When the current line begins with being in the middle of a string and
   the closing delimiter(s) of the string is / are on the same line
   indentation doesn't appear to affect the line, but perhaps this is
   desirable.

   (def a
     ``
     hello
    ``)     # this is the line in question

2) Note that spork/fmt will not change the indentation in the above case,
   but it affects the number of spaces between the closing paren and the
   comment:

   (def a
     ``
     hello
    ``) # this is the line in question

3) For the current line, if the left-most non-whitespace character's
   context is the top-level, shift to the left as much as possible
   (i.e. no whitespace before the left-most non-whitespace character).

   So assuming the following is the only content in a file (indented by
   2 spaces), change:

     (def x 2) # the open paren's context is top-level

   to:

   (def x 2) # the open paren's context is top-level

   Resulting in no indentation, i.e. shift to the left by 2.

4) What about quoted tuples (and nested ones)?  It may be that the
   current spork/fmt behavior is sensible:

   https://github.com/janet-lang/spork/issues/25

   '(:a
      :b
      :c)

   [:a
    :b
    :c]

   Our algorithm produces the same result.

   A few other "leading" characters to consider:

   ~
   ;
   |
   ,

   What to do for those cases?  Also, are there any other characters
   that have not been considered?

5) In the general case, I think it is necessary to do something like
   go back to the beginning of the buffer and start scanning from that
   spot in order to determine correctly if the first character on your
   current line is in a string or not.

   Consider the extreme case of a file with one big long string that
   starts with a delimiter on the first line and ends with a delimiter
   on the last line.  If the current line is in the middle of the
   file, AFAICT there is no way to determine whether the first
   character on the line is in a string or not just by scanning
   locally.

   I don't think there is any way perfect way around this.  Using
   tree-sitter effectively achieves this end without using
   functionality that an editor provides.  However, tree-sitter
   may not handle broken code so well.

   Note that it might be possible to scan from the end of the file
   backwards to some point before the current line, parsing in reverse
   to achieve a similar end, but this might require a specially
   crafted parser and it's still a linear scan from one extreme.

   There is also the idea of the column zero convention.
